Experimental Matlab library to read and parse ionTOF ITA,ITM and ITS fileformat.

For the moment only the ITA files are supported for Matlab. Check the python library pyTOF ( https://github.com/scholi/pyTOF ) for more.

This library is in its early stage and as no documentation is available for the ionTOF fileformat this library might contains some mistakes. Please check the informations before scientific publications...

Enjoy!

## Note
This library is not maintained and is deprecated.
Plase either use the python library pySPM (https://github.com/scholi/pySPM) or update this one.
